### 🖼️ Sample Workflow

```
Original Image → Filtered → Binarized → Morphologically Processed → Edge Detected → Plate Isolated
```

## 🧠 Technical Deep Dive

### 🔬 Image Processing Algorithms

#### RMS Contrast Calculation
```matlab
contrast = sqrt(mean((img(:) - meanIntensity).^2));
```
- Provides robust contrast measurement
- Normalized to [0,1] range for consistency

#### Custom Grayscale Conversion
```matlab
grayscaleImg = 0.2989*R + 0.5870*G + 0.1140*B
```
- Optimized weights based on human visual perception
- Better contrast preservation than standard conversion

#### Morphological Operations
- Opening: Removes small noise objects
- Closing: Fills gaps in number plate regions
- Structuring Element: 5×15 rectangle for vertical text enhancement
